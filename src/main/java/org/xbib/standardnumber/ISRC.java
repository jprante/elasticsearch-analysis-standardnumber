 *
 * The International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is an international standard code for uniquely
 * identifying sound recordings and music video recordings.
 *
 * An ISRC code identifies a particular recording, not the work (composition and lyrical content)
 * itself. Therefore, different recordings, edits, and remixes of the same work should each have
 * their own ISRC code. Works are identified by ISWC codes. Recordings remastered without
 * significant audio-quality changes should not have unique ISRC codes, but the threshold is
 * left to the discretion of the record company.
