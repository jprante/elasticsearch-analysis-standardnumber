/**
 * ISO 26324: Digital Object Identifier System (DOI)
 *
 * Z39.50 BIB-1 Use Attribute 1094
 *
 * DOI is an acronym for "digital object identifier", meaning a "digital identifier of an object"
 * rather than an "identifier of a digital object". The DOI system was initiated by the
 * International DOI Foundation in 1998, and initially developed with the collaboration
 * of some participants in ISO/TC46/SC9. Due to its application in the fields of
 * information and documentation and previous collaboration with some ISO/TC46/SC9 participants,
 * it was introduced as a possible work item in 2004 and further developed from 2006 to 2010.
 *
 * The DOI system is designed to work over the Internet. A DOI name is permanently assigned
 * to an object to provide a resolvable persistent network link to current information about
 * that object, including where the object, or information about it, can be found on the
 * Internet. While information about an object can change over time, its DOI name will not
 * change. A DOI name can be resolved within the DOI system to values of one or more types
 * of data relating to the object identified by that DOI name, such as a URL, an e-mail address,
 * other identifiers and descriptive metadata.
 *
 * The DOI system enables the construction of automated services and transactions.
 * Applications of the DOI system include but are not limited to managing information
 * and documentation location and access; managing metadata; facilitating electronic
 * transactions; persistent unique identification of any form of any data; and commercial
 * and non-commercial transactions.
 *
 * The content of an object associated with a DOI name is described unambiguously
 * by DOI metadata, based on a structured extensible data model that enables the object
 * to be associated with metadata of any desired degree of precision and granularity
 * to support description and services. The data model supports interoperability
 * between DOI applications.
 *
 * The scope of the DOI system is not defined by reference to the type of content
 * (format, etc.) of the referent, but by reference to the functionalities it provides
 * and the context of use. The DOI system provides, within networks of DOI applications,
 * for unique identification, persistence, resolution, metadata and semantic interoperability.
