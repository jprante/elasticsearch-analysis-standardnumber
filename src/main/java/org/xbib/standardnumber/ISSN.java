/**
 * ISO 3297 International Standard Serial Number (ISSN)
 *
 * Z39.50 BIB-1 Use Attribute 8
 *
 * The International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is a unique
 * eight-digit number used to identify a print or electronic periodical
 * publication. The ISSN system was adopted as international standard
 * ISO 3297 in 1975. The ISO subcommittee TC 46/SC 9 is responsible
 * for the standard.
 *
 * Quoted from http://www.issn.org/2-22636-All-about-ISSN.php
 *
 * The ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) is an eight-digit number
 * which identifies periodical publications as such, including electronic
 * serials.
 *
 * The ISSN is a numeric code which is used as an identifier: it has no
 * signification in itself and does not contain in itself any information
 * referring to the origin or contents of the publication.
 *
 * The ISSN takes the form of the acronym ISSN followed by two groups
 * of four digits, separated by a hyphen. The eighth character is a
 * control digit calculated according to a modulo 11 algorithm on
 * the basis of the 7 preceding digits; this eighth control character
 * may be an "X" if the result of the computing is equal to "10",
 * in order to avoid any ambiguity.
 *
 *  The ISSN is linked to a standardized form of the title of the
 *  identified serial, known as the "key title", which repeats
 *  the title of the publication, qualifying it with additional elements
 *  in order to distinguish it from other publications having identical
 *  titles.
 *
 *  If the title of the publication changes in any significant way,
 *  a new ISSN must be assigned in order to correspond to this new form
 *  of title and avoid any confusion. A serial publication whose
 *  title is modified several times in the course of its existence
 *  will be assigned each time a new ISSN, thus allowing precise
 *  identification of each form of the title : in fact it is then
 *  considered that they are different publications even if there
 *  is a logical link between them.
 *
 *  Contrary to other types of publications, the world of serial
 *  publications is particularly changeable and complex :
 *  the lifetime of a title may be extremely short; many publications
 *  may be part of a complex set of relationships, etc.
 *  These particularities themselves necessitated the introduction
 *  of the ISSN.
