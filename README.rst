Standardnumber Analysis Plugin for Elasticsearch
================================================

Standardnumber is an analysis plugin for `Elasticsearch <http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch>`_.

What are standard numbers? Standard numbers are globally unique character sequences, often digits, with
rules, domains, and canonical forms defined by standardization bodies or organizations like the
International Organisation for Standardization (ISO).
For using valid standard numbers only, often check digits are used. The main
purpose of standard numbers is the identifcation of items.

Because standard numbers may appear in some literal variants, the canonical form must be deduced from the input
so standard numbers can be compared for equivalence.

With the standard number analysis, you can use a token filter for finding standard numbers and index
them in canonical form plus all their valid variants.

Currently, only ISBN (International Standard Book Number) is implemented.

Other standard numbers will follow: EAN, GTIN, IBAN, ISAN, ISMN, ISNI, ISSN, ISTC, ISWC, LCCN, ORCID, PPN, SICI, UPC and ZDB.

Example
=======

In the settings, set up a token filter of type "standardnumber"::

    {
       "index" : {
          "analysis" : {
              "filter" : {
                  "standardnumber" : {
                      "type" : "standardnumber"
                  }
              },
              "analyzer" : {
                  "standardnumber" : {
                      "tokenizer" : "whitespace",
                      "filter" : [ "standardnumber", "unique" ]
                  }
              }
          }
       }
    }

By using such an analyzer, the content ``Die ISBN von Elasticsearch in Action lautet 9781617291623``
will be tokenized into::

    "Die",
    "ISBN",
    "von",
    "Elasticsearch",
    "in",
    "Action",
    "lautet",
    "9781617291623",
    "978-1-61729-162-3"

The formatting of ISBN-13 was added as an extra token to the stream.

It is recommended to add the `Unique token filter <http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/index-modules/analysis/unique-tokenfilter.html>`_
to skip tokens that occur more than once.

Another example
===============

The content ``Die ISBN von Lucene in Action lautet 1-9339-8817-7.`` will be tokenized into::

    "Die",
    "ISBN",
    "von",
    "Lucene",
    "in",
    "Action",
    "lautet",
    "1-9339-8817-7.",
    "1-933988-17-7",
    "1933988177",
    "978-1-933988-17-7",
    "9781933988177"

ISBN-10 were the only form valid before Januar 1, 2007. Such old ISBNs will be reformatted, validated, and
normalized into ISBN-10/ISBN13 variant forms, which are added as extra tokens to the token stream.
